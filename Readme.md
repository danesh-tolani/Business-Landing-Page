# Project 12

Hi, My name is **Danesh Tolani** and I have completed the 12th Project of the iNeuron Full Stack Course.

The most challenging things were:

- Placing the play button at the center of the image with the white borders
- Creating the cards and aligning them properly

It took me **6 Hours** to complete this project
